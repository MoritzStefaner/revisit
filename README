revisit

a real-time visualization of the latest twitter messages (tweets) around a specific topic. Use it create your own twitter wall at a conference or an ambient display at your company or whatever other idea you come up with. In contrast to other twitterwalls, it provides a sense of the temporal dynamics in the twitter stream, and emphasizes the conversational threads established by retweets and @replies.

If you want to use this distribution to create an installation or a twitter wall, just customize bin/index_standalone.html according to your needs. Some caveats: The "showOnlyToday" option does not recognize when you run the installation for multiple days. Also, I have not tested extensively for memory leaks etc. so you might have to restart the installation every other day or so.

If you want to embed it into your website:

* install the twitterproxy php files on your web server
http://wiki.swfjunkie.com/tweetr
direct download:
http://wiki.swfjunkie.com/_media/tweetr:tweetr_1.0b2_proxy.zip

* change line 118 in Tweetr.php to 
$twitterURL = 'http://search.twitter.com'.str_replace($this->baseURL,'',$this->url['path']);

* provide a twitterProxyURL parameter pointing to your twitterproxy installation in bin/index.html

* upload the bin directory to your webserver
